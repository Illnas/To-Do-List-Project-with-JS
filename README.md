To Do List Project with JS

Finally finished this one. Had to alternate between work at home and work on breaks in Algebra classrooms.
But here it is! 

JS part, was not that hard. Considering fact that I was using appendChild and targeting nodes and the
fact that I never used those, I thought it would take more time (and lines XD).

Note: material icon spans inside buttons need to be full width and height, in order to cover button.
      Those spans act like they are above buttons, which was weird but I found alternative to it.
      
      
     
Anyway, onwards to next project!
